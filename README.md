Technology of recent has become a major part of human lives, we have seen a lot of technological advancements in all areas of life, from transportation, communication, energy etc. Healthcare is not exempted from these advancements, as it has become an integral part of healthcare in the world today. Most notably, in predictive modelling, where machine learning models are used to study useful patterns and trends in large volume of healthcare data and health related predictions are made. NHS (2021) reiterated the importance of this technological tool as it leads to better operational efficiencies, improved patient safety and improved patient outcomes. In this report, we discussed how predictive modelling are used in determining the length of patient stay in hos-pitals by utilizing an open-source Microsoft dataset, which mimics real-world hospital scenarios. This dataset contains useful patient records such as gender, readmission count, list of medical issues they have or have had in the past etc. Covering different areas of the project, like visualiza-tion, data cleaning or preprocessing, manipulation, experimentation, tuning etc. Discussions on the performances of the different models using evaluation metrics like mean absolute error and r-squared will also be covered in details. Further integration of advanced machine learning tools like shapley explanations additives and partial dependency plots will also be explored to give more context on the performances of the models.
